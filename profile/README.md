## The Early History of Calculators

### The Abacus: The First Known Calculating Device

The earliest form of a calculator was the abacus, which dates back to 2400 BCE in Mesopotamia. It was widely used by merchants and traders to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Mechanical Calculators: Pascaline and Leibniz Wheel

In the 17th century, mathematicians and inventors began creating mechanical calculators. The Pascaline, developed by Blaise Pascal in 1642, could perform addition and subtraction. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz later improved it with the Leibniz Wheel, introducing multiplication and division.
